Tracktern
Tracktern is an AI-assisted internship intelligence platform that helps students discover, evaluate, organize, and act on opportunities faster. It combines resume analysis, opportunity parsing, authenticity checks, deadline tracking, and application-status analytics in a single dashboard.

Project Overview
Tracktern is designed for students who apply to many internships across different platforms and often lose track of deadlines, fit, and progress. The app centralizes this process by:

Building a profile from resume text and detected skills.
Parsing opportunity messages and links into structured records.
Scoring authenticity and candidate-opportunity match.
Prioritizing opportunities based on urgency and relevance.
Tracking application status from Applied to Offer.
Surfacing analytics to improve application strategy.
Core Features
1. Authentication and Session Management
Register, login, logout flows.
Password hashing with bcryptjs.
Session persistence through express-session and connect-mongo.
Secure cookie and request hardening headers in app middleware.
2. Resume Intelligence
Resume text upload and normalization.
Skill extraction via heuristics and optional LLM enrichment.
Resume score generation with strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions.
Suggested bullet improvements for stronger resume impact.
Profile-level role suggestions (AI-first, static fallback).
3. Opportunity Parsing and Enrichment
Accepts raw opportunity text and optional source link.
Uses Gemini (when configured) to extract structured data: company, role, required skills, eligibility, deadline, application link.
Falls back to rule-based extraction when AI response is missing/invalid.
Fetches and parses link context to improve extraction confidence.
4. Authenticity and Risk Scoring
Scores opportunities based on: direct link presence, HTTPS usage, trusted host matching, and content completeness.
Detects suspicious phrases (fees, urgency pressure, off-platform contact cues).
Produces a score and explanation string for dashboard transparency.
5. Match Scoring and Prioritization
Compares required skills against user profile and resume-detected skills.
Computes match score and labels (Low, Medium, High).
Derives missing skills and recommended improvements.
Calculates urgency using parsed deadlines and flags critical items.
6. Deadline and Calendar Support
Normalizes deadline formats (12-hour and 24-hour variants).
Detects implicit deadline signals in text.
Generates one-click Google Calendar event links with enriched event details.
7. Status Tracking and Dashboard Analytics
Per-opportunity status transitions: Applied, Interview, Rejected, Offer.
Status history timeline with notes.
Dashboard metrics for totals, high-match opportunities, and near deadlines.
Chart-ready distributions (status, category, monthly applications, skills).
8. Telegram Intake (Optional)
Optional long-polling Telegram bot flow for opportunity intake.
Supports both command-based and plain-text opportunity ingestion.
Includes duplicate detection and fallback extraction.
Polling can be controlled via environment flags for safe deployments.
High-Level Architecture
Runtime: Node.js + Express + EJS views.
Persistence: MongoDB (Atlas preferred) via Mongoose models.
Session store: Mongo-backed sessions with in-memory fallback when needed.
AI integration: @google/genai (Gemini) with safe fallbacks to deterministic parsers.
Deploy targets:
Render for persistent web service runtime.
Vercel serverless adapter through api/index.js and vercel.json rewrites.

Local Development
Prerequisites
Node.js 18+
npm
MongoDB Atlas URI (recommended) or local MongoDB
Setup
Install dependencies:
npm install
Create environment file from template:
cp .env.example .env
Run the app:
npm run dev
Open:
http://localhost:3000
If your local workspace stores source files under a Code directory, run these commands from that directory.

Environment Variables
Variable	Required	Description
MONGODB_ATLAS_URI	Yes (production)	MongoDB Atlas connection string
MONGO_URI	Optional	Local Mongo fallback URI
SESSION_SECRET	Yes	Session signing secret
LLM_API_KEY	Recommended	Gemini/LLM API key for extraction and analysis
GEMINI_API_KEY	Optional	Alternate key name used by some routes
PORT	Optional	HTTP port (default 3000)
ENABLE_TELEGRAM_BOT	Optional	true/false to control polling bot startup
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN	Optional	Required only when Telegram bot is enabled
NODE_ENV	Optional	environment mode (test/production/development)
Testing
Run all tests:

npm test
Run unit tests:

npm run test:unit
Run integration tests:

npm run test:integration
Run coverage:

npm run test:coverage
Test suite includes:

Deadline parsing and normalization
Google Calendar link generation
Helper function behavior
Resume analysis logic
End-to-end route integration flow
Deployment Notes
Live instance is available on Render at: https://tracktran.onrender.com
For persistent Telegram polling, deploy on a long-running host and control polling with ENABLE_TELEGRAM_BOT.
On Vercel, requests are routed through api/index.js (serverless adapter), and polling is automatically avoided.
Future Enhancements
Background refresh jobs for stale opportunities
Multi-user collaboration and shared shortlists
Richer recruiter/company trust signals
Exportable application reports and reminders
